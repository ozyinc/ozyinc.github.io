I have worked in a startup named Stylelounge in Germany, in which I was a part of a real startup environment, and I learned about many software development practices there. I had also had my first conference experience when I attended <a href=https://www.codetalks.de/>code.talks</a> with some colleagues from Stylelounge.</li><li>Gittigidiyor (eBay Turkey):
I have been an intern in the largest e-commerce marketplace in Turkey. I was then allowed to create a project on my own, with some guidance from my seniors, and have successfully developed a web-app for internal uses.</li><li>ESENSI (Sierra Nevada Corp. Turkey):
I have had my first software engineering experience here, which made me realize how different the actual working environment is from the homework we had at the university. I have created a simulator with other interns using Java and OMG DDS compliant libraries, which was my first peek into enterprise integration and QoS policies for data transfer.</li></ul><h3 id=education>Education<a href=#education class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3><p>I have graduated from one of the best universities in Turkey (and leading in CS in Turkey, according to QS) with a high honors degree. During my academic career, I have improved myself by building software used by the organizations that I participated in. I have started my Master&rsquo;s Degree at Milan Polytechnic University in mid-September, specializing in Machine Learning.</p><h3 id=personal>Personal<a href=#personal class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3><p>I enjoy watching dev talks, create projects that never end, read books, (and from time to time, I update this website &#x1f603;). I play tennis whenever I find the opportunity to, ski in the winter and take a walk when I need some distraction.</p><p>More details about me available in <a href=/cv/>my CV</a>.</p></div></main><footer id=site-footer class="section-inner thin animated fadeIn faster"><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=https://ozyinc.com/></a>&#183; &#183; <a href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CC BY-NC 4.0</a> | Some extra icons from <a href=http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/ target=_blank>Font Awesome</a>

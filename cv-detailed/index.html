However, some highlights that made me a better developer are:</p><p><button class=collapsible>Introduction to Computer Engineering Concepts (CENG111)</button><div class=collapsible-content>This introductory course was the first course among many that I took during my studies that introduced me to the fundamentals of computer science and engineering. During this course I have learned:</p><ul><li>fundamental functionality of a basic CPU, which was astonishing on how it reflects the general functionalities and issues regarding computer programming (mainly robustness and step-by-step execution of programs).</li><li>basics of recursion and iteration, and how to map one to other, considering the implications that this has for dynamic programming and many other algorithms I would personally consider this the best contribution.</li><li>basics of complexity analysis</li><li>Ubuntu, Linux and the GNU ecosystem</li><li>and Python 😀</li></ul></div><p><button class=collapsible>C Programming (CENG140)</button><div class=collapsible-content>As the second course about CENG that I took, this course has introduced me to the C language and it&rsquo;s low-level complex beauty. While learning how to write efficient code and managing dynamic memory, our instructor has also introduced us to how the memory in a computer is managed and what parts do programs have, answering many questions that I had while learning Python. Even though most of the topics were merely an introduction to the concepts and ideas of the programming languages and operating systems courses in the future, it has succeeded in creating an overall idea and appreciation of the hardships of the field that our predecessors have faced regarding basic optimization.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Logic Design (CENG232)</button><div class=collapsible-content>I took this course in my first year, and it provided a better understanding of the actual implementation of various parts of the computer, starting with a few logic gates and adding clocks to provide sequential execution. With this course I have learned how specific mechanisms needed for a computer&rsquo;s functionality can be realized, and it also introduced me to FPGA programming using Verilog.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Data Structures (CENG213)</button><div class=collapsible-content>This course, even if it has covered many basic data structures (like stacks, queues, linked list, trees, arrays, etc&mldr;), has a special place in my memory, due to its detailed insights on workings of hash tables.With this course I learned a lot of different hashing techniques and algorithms determining the overflow strategy, that allowed me to reason about their usage in different scenarios and places.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Programming Language Concepts (CENG242)</button><div class=collapsible-content>Within this course, I was first introduced to core ideas of different programming paradigms.</p><p>Especially the ideas behind <a href=https://www.haskell.org/>Haskell</a> have amazed me since it was my first encounter with a language that doesn&rsquo;t inherit C-style programming (even if one might argue some aspects of Python) or doesn&rsquo;t follow an imperative (also object-oriented) mind set of thinking about code. Another aspect was the idea of pure functions (Monads or IO was out of the scope of the course) and the type system. I was familiar with the idea that using functions one can emulate the same process of a Turing machine according to the Church-Turing hypothesis, however realizing there is a large ecosystem based on Church&rsquo;s ideas has also been an important revelation.</p><p>I have also learned about the scope resolution of different OOP languages and different types of argument passing used in different languages. I have also learned about how C arrays have a weird quirk about whether they are a type or not in the language&rsquo;s type system and what lazy evaluation is.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Algorithms (CENG315)</button><div class=collapsible-content>On the algorithms course I have learned about the details of various graph and string algorithms.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Computer Organization (CENG331)</button><div class=collapsible-content>This course has been a very delightful one to learn, considering that it was the second step in understanding how computers function internally (after Logic Design). Starting from basic addition to details on CPU functionality and caches.</p><p>The homework given for this course have featured some of many creative tasks that I have seen in my academic career, reading a binary program to defuse a bomb, hacking a binary using buffer overflow and return oriented programming, optimizing matrix multiplication to use available caches and increase its speed at least 4 times.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Data Management and File Structures (CENG351)</button><div class=collapsible-content>This course was mainly about SQL databases work and how files are stored in various systems. I took this course after having a decent experience in SQL and fairly good knowledge on inodes and storage mechanisms of OS, since I already took Operating Systems class. However, in this course I have learned about storage of block data and how indexes built (with B+ Trees).</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Introduction to Operating Systems (CENG334)</button><div class=collapsible-content>As a sequel to CENG331, I have learned about mechanisms that operating systems use to execute programs in a secure and fast manner, while allocating resources to different programs executing in (pseudo-)parallel in a way that there is no deadlock.</p><p>Also in this course I have learned about processes, threads and synchronization between those. This has contributed a better understanding to me about how locks and semaphores work. Furthermore, I have enjoyed reading and solving the problems in Little Book of Semaphores, and the MINIX book by Andrew S. Tannenbaum afterwards (even though I never got to finish it).</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Data Communications and Networking (CENG435)</button><div class=collapsible-content></p><p>Before taking this course I had fairly good knowledge about different high-level protocols, like HTTP(S), FTP, SSH, Telnet, etc. and a faint idea on how the internal mechanisms worked. During this course I had the opportunity to learn how each networking layer functions, various different protocols and their efficiencies. As a Computer Engineering course, the course had some details on how the low-level signal is transmitted from the cable but obviously we didn&rsquo;t dive deep into the specifics of the physics (I was told that Electronic Engineers have a more comprehensive course on that).</p><p>With this course, I was able to understand the current implementations of some widely used protocols like TCP, UDP, IP, DHCP. The understanding allowed me to better evaluate current technologies we have, have a better understanding of networking components of cloud systems and their security and decreased the entry barrier for understanding new standards of protocols like HTTP/3.</p></div><p><button class=collapsible>Computer Engineering Design (CENG491-CENG492)</button><div class=collapsible-content></p><p>This course (also known as the graduation project) has allowed me to use the things that I have learned by myself and during my internship at Stylelounge to create a product with a team of fellow senior students. The main aim of the course was not to deliver a production-ready app but just to create an MVP to showcase the product. For the details of the project visit: <strong>TODO</strong>
.</p><p>With this course I had my first challenge on being part of a team and discussing architectural choices for a greenfield project for the first time. I have built greenfield projects before in my life (especially for METU YES and Stylelounge) but the scope was limited to a few components, and the team size of those projects were 1 (myself) with occasional discussions with my fellow engineers and my supervisor.</p></div></div><p><button class=collapsible>Extracurricular Activities</button><div class=collapsible-content></p><p>During my time at METU I took an active role in many student societies and hosted some events regarding those. Some societies I have participated in:</p><p><button class=collapsible>METU Young Entrepreneurs Society (METU YES)</button><div class=collapsible-content>I was a member of the society for 3 years, of which I was the IT coordinator for 1.5 years. During my time I took responsibility for organizing many events (like Crystal Tree Awarding Ceremony, Entrepreneurship and Engineering Summit and NASA Space Apps Challenge) and interviews and maintained and improved the infrastructure needs of the society.</p><p>During my time in the society I got to know many people from my university and from the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Turkey.
